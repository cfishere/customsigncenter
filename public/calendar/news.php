				<p><span style="font-weight:bold">New Feature "BackUp" button (btn)</span>:</p>
				<p>
					<span style="font-weight:bold; color:royalblue">Take Away:</span><br>
					Continue using the "Save Update" btn as always. The Backup function is like saving a Word document with a different name as a backup. You won't see the btn unless logged in w/ full editing rights.

					<span style="font-weight:bold; color:orangered">Why was this feature necessary?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				A: The xml file that holds the WIP data and notes is large and complex.  During a "Save Updates" operation, the data from the browser is collected, processed on the remote server for XML import, and then replaces the entire XML contents with the new updates.  If the server encounters any problem, it's possible that the server script will save a completely empty calendar--not only are you current updates lost, the entire calendar for that company could be lost.  (We do create a back up manually every morning of the calendars.)  In that situation you'd notify IT, and we would restore the old backup from the morning, meaning you lost all the prior updates you saved during that day.
				</p>
				<p>
				<span style="font-weight:bold; color:orangered">Can I restore a Backup?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				A: Currently, only the IT team can restore a backup based upon a user request.  (In the works is a page that will allow Admins to view a list of backup files, and the dates + times they were created; this will be a way for the admin to restore their own backups.)
