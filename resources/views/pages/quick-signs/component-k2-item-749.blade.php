              <ol>
                <li>Business First! Make sure that your vehicle magnet displays your company name/ brand and services. It’s important that your audience know who you are and what you can offer them immediately.</li>
                <li>Emphasize your motto. Add a tagline, marketing message, or phrase that tells your audience why they should hire you for the job. Make this statement short and memorable.</li>
                <li>Be available. Always put current and accurate contact information on your sign. Make your contact information bold and visible, so that you don’t miss out on potential customers.</li>
                <li>Include your website to increase mobile traffic.</li>
                <li>Use Contrasting colors. Use your company colors in a contrasting manner that will allow for maximum readability. The use of text in one color and contact information in another color will maximize the readability.</li>
                <li>Make sure the content of your car magnet is easy to read and in fonts that are pleasing to the eye.</li>
