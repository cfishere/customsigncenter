            <p>Ground signs are permanent, free-standing structures that are most commonly installed on site by means of concrete footers. The above-ground structure is attached to the footer via galvanized fasteners or mortar or, less frequently, placed into the footer while it is poured. This type of sign is commonly placed outside of banks, high end car dealers and businesses who deal in luxury items. These structures require planning, zone permitting approval, installation coordination and expertise, and careful engineering.<br> <br> Ground signs may be subdivided into (1) Pylon signs (pole signs) and (2) monument signs. While ground signs are ideally suited for roadside displays and property entryways, elevated pole signs are effective for marking the location of the advertiser, and drawing traffic from a greater distance.Ground Signs are your typical monument type signage.&nbsp;They are installed at ground level and are free standing signs. For those times when having a pole or pylon sign is unfeasible, we recommended the option of a ground sign.&nbsp;These ground level signs are an <strong>effective and tasteful </strong>alternative, as well as being <strong>one of the most durable</strong> forms of advertising available.<br> <br> Think about this; studies have been done, and there are a lot of them, that detail how a well designed and well placed sign can have a remarkable effect on your businesses bottom line. Your ground sign will work for you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and how ever many days a year that you are open, as well as the days you are closed. Some studies suggest that 35% of motorists who saw your sign will convey to a friend information about your business. So even if they don't stop right away, if they need your services and liked your sign they will come back, or their friend will. These ground signs (monument, pole, and pylon) will convey your message to the masses and ingrain the identity of your brand into your audience's mind. &nbsp;Designing your sign is of utmost importance. Our designers can help with that. Our designers are diligent when it comes to the design of your signs. They work tirelessly to create the perfect motif for your business' needs. They will guide you to effective color combinations and design configurations to make your sign the best business tool in your toolkit. In 2014 alone vehicles traveled over 1,396,098 miles in the US.
