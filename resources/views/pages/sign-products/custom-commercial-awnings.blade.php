                  <h4>Eradicated Backlit Awnings &amp; Canopies</h4>
                  <p>Eradicolor is ideal for backlit awnings &amp; signage with single background colors. Designs and logos may be added through eradication, inlaying additional colors where desired.&nbsp;Currently designed for everyday signage, usage is intended where the requirements are for medium-term durability. &nbsp;Available in a range of colors, the awning and sign faces can be decorated with translucent vinyl or digitally printed backlit material.&nbsp;The exposed white background, in area or eradication, stays white as a result of high quality pigments and additives that provide resistance to UV, heat degradation, and microbial protection. The 20’ x 14’ high strength polyester scrim embedded in the cast PVC gives strength for easy tensioning and avoids aging.&nbsp;The special combination of materials has excellent light diffusion properties and increase visibility of the graphic while hiding structural components.<br>
                    Eradication is a process where&nbsp;Translucent eradicable vinyl fabrics are used and the graphics are created by chemically eradicating the color surface using a computer-cut stencil mask to reveal the white substrate. Custom awning &amp; canopy colors are shown in the image. Click to see a larger view.<br>
