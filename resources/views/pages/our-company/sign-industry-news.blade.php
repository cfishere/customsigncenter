Tomferry.com suggests putting out 20 or 30 signs for your open house. Realestatecareermentor.com says to use at least 10 or more. Melissa Lynn, Property Manager for

                                    at Templeton/Citation Club/Noble Park tells me that ‘without signage her open houses would not be possible.’ Not only will you drive traffic to your open house but the traffic you receive may help to fill your pipeline with future buyers/sellers or residents. According to the American Apartment Owners Association 50% or more of visits from potential renters traditionally come from your rental signs. More traffic always leads to more leases/offers.

                                        Keeping your overhead down is a must. It’s like the old saying; A penny saved is a penny earned. Sticking to your budget doesn’t have to hurt your bottom line. Signage is one marketing medium that you pay for once and it keeps on working for you for a long time to come. The cost of our yard signs is as low as $3.90 each, plus the cost of the frames and stakes. It’s not like hiring an assistant to go out and pound the pavement to bring in potential customers. Not only is that employee unable to speak to everyone that would see your signs, but a vivid, full color sign can make a more positive impression on your potential clients. In addition, your sign will never be sick or take a vacation. Posted on thedesignfoundation.org is a study aptly named: The Economic Value of On-premise Signage, written by the Economic Center at the University of Cincinnati.3 It states that 76% of consumers said they had entered a store or business they had never visited before based simply on its signs. 3 67% said they had purchased a product or service because the sign caught their eye. 3 This is huge! That’s nearly 8 in 10 people. Xerox released the results of a study that showed “Color increases readers’ attentions spans and recall by 82 %.” When you add photos to backup your points made in your content, retention rates climb even higher.4 Signs.org discusses a survey that states ‘only 1% of first-time customers come in because of your television ad. But 50% come in because of your sign. If you're spending only $0.11 cents per 1,000 exposures to get that 50%, that's a good use of your money.’2 Their survey discussed a double sided pole sign for a car lot, which had 60,000 motorists passing by each day, and estimated the sign would last 7 years, this is where they came up with the $0.11 per exposure. What is your cost per lead? The consensus is, if you want to reduce that cost, buy more signs!

                                        Thousands of businesses out there are wondering how to increase the traffic to their websites. This is a common problem with Real Estate Agents as well as Property Managers. Without traffic you don’t get leads. Without leads you don’t make sales. Without sales there is no revenue. This is not a logic fallacy, this is reality. You need unique visitors to your site. Other advertising, like an online ILS, or local printed guide book costs monthly. Some can be pretty pricey. Once you purchase your signage and get your design just right, there is no further cost. Put them out when you need them, and store them away to keep them well preserved when you don’t. They drive traffic to your website 24/7 and never take a day off!

                                        Word of mouth (WOM) marketing should be a considered strategy of every business, and signage can be an effective promoter of that, too. What is WOM?  Example: I am driving down the road, and I see a cool sign for an apartment community. I loved the sign and remember that my friend is looking for an apartment. Because I saw the sign, and remembered it, I told my friend and she called and put in an application for your rental. Even though I did not need your service, your sign worked for you. 33% of people who see a sign will tell someone else about the service and location. That’s how you spread the word! Additionally thesignagefoundation.org study by the University of Cincinnati also says about 75% of consumers have entered a location because of a sign, and most also indicated that a bad sign or no sign deters them from entering.2 Your sign’s readability is the most important factor when designing your sign. Going back to the Xerox study it’s the color and composition that attract the eye and enhance your benefits.

With an integrated approach to your marketing you will make your marketing spend work better for you and your business. While you should never rely on only one advertising medium, like signage, remember that 50% of your traffic comes from these quiet marketeers. Use many different types of signage to guide customers to your open house, convey the promise of your brand, lower your costs while increasing revenue, drive traffic to your website and get others to spread the word about your brand.
